# dotCmd

NOTE: This project as of now is in hevy developement and cannot be even considered alpha.

dotCmd aims to give .NET developers a much more advanced console by using the Native ConsoleHost apis. 

dotCmd splits the output buffer into multiple regions each with it's own buffer. This enables us to create things like progress bars and headers and footers within a console.

dotCmd (will) provides an extended input biffer with functionalities like tab completion and command history.
